<h2 class="mume-header" id="domainmodel">DomainModel</h2>

<p>In order to provide the features describe above, the application is centered around a domain model and the objects it is comprised of.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/DomainModel.png" alt="DomainModel.png"></p>
<p>Objects in the domain model can be classified in the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>nomenclature objects [N] - nomenclature objects form different catalogs in the system;</li>
<li>operations objects [O] - operations objects represent various activities and actions performed by the users;</li>
<li>setup objects [S] - setup objects represent different pieces of information which control the operations and processes of the system;</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of objects in the domain model, their classification (with [N], [O] or [S] after the object name) and short description:</p>
<p><strong>Item [N]</strong></p>
<p>This object represents an entry in the Item catalog. Items could be traded in the system - sales and purchases. In this context, Item object has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>code - unique identifier of the Item;</li>
<li>name - description of the Item;</li>
<li>sales price - the price which is used when selling the Item;</li>
<li>purchase price - the price which is used when purchasing the Item;</li>
<li>inventory - shows the current inventory of the Item. It is sum of all the quantities that have been purchases minus the quantities which have been sold.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Customer [N]</strong></p>
<p>This object represents and entry in the Customer catalog. Customers are entities which Items are sold to. In order to do that, Sales documents are created and posted. In this context, Customer object has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>code - unique identifier of the Customer;</li>
<li>name - name of the Customer;</li>
<li>address - address of the Customer;</li>
<li>payment method - payment method of the Customer. Based on this payment method a payment is filed automatically or not. To be further described in the Payment Method object.</li>
<li>balance - shows the current balance of the Customer. It is sum of all the amounts of Sales documents posted minus the payments done by the Customer. Positive balance means that the Customer ows the respective amount.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vendor [N]</strong></p>
<p>This object represents and entry in the Vendor catalog. Vendors are entities which Items are purchased from. In order to do that, Purchase documents are created and posted. In this context, Vendor object has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>code - unique identifier of the Vendor;</li>
<li>name - name of the Vendor;</li>
<li>address - address of the Vendor;</li>
<li>payment method - payment method of the Vendor. Based on this payment a payment is filed automatically or not. To be further described in the Payment Method object.</li>
<li>balance - shows the current balance of the Vendor. It is sum of all the amounts of Purchase documents posted minus the payments done by the Vendor. Positive balance means that the Vendor is woned the respective amount.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank Account [N]</strong></p>
<p>This object represents an entity which stores financial assets. The name &quot;Bank Account&quot; implies that it is only accounts in a bank, but this is not the case. It could be any means of financial assets. Examples: a wallet, a vault, bank account in Bank X, bank account in Bank Y, etc. In this context, Bank Account object has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>code - unique identifier of the Bank Account;</li>
<li>name - name of the Bank Account;</li>
<li>balance - shows the financial asserts available in the bank account. It is sum of all the payments and refunds done with the bank account. Besides payments and refunds, financial assets could be moved between bank accounts. These operations are entered in the system as free entries (instead of payment or refund). To be further described in the operations objects and Processes sections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Payment Methods [N]</strong></p>
<p>This object represents how payments from/to Customers/Vendors are done. There are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>immediate payments - if the payment is immediate, a corresponding Bank Account is specified in the Payment Method. The payment/refund is done in this Bank Account.</li>
<li>delayed payments - if the payment is delayed, no corresponding Bank Account is specified in the Payment Method. The payment/refund is done later and is entered into the system manually.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, Payment Method object has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>code - unique identifier of the Payment Method;</li>
<li>name - name of the Payment Method;</li>

<p>This object represents an <strong>intent</strong> by the Customer to <strong>buy</strong> a certain items. In this context, Sales Order object has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>code - unique identifier of the Sales Order. Automatically generated by the system using code serie. See Code Serie object and Processes for mode details;</li>
<li>customer - the Customer the order is done by;</li>
<li>date - the date the order is created;</li>
<li>payment method - by default this is taken from the Customer the order is done for. However, it could be changed for the concrete Sales Order;</li>
<li>amount - shows the total amount of the Sales Order. It is sum of the amount of the respective Sales Order Lines. See below;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sales Order Line [O]</strong></p>
<p>This object represents a separate item uncluded in the Sales Order. In this context, Sales Order Line object has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>sales order - shows the Sales Order this line belongs to;</li>
<li>line no - since a single Sales Order could have multiple lines, this field is used to distinguish different lines belonging to a single Sales Order;</li>
<li>item - the Item this line represents;</li>
<li>quantity - the quantity of the Item that will be sold;</li>
<li>price - the price the Item will be sold on. It is taken from the sales price field of the Item object. However, it could be changed for this particular Sales Order Line;</li>
<li>amount - calculated by multiplying the quantity and the price fields;</li>

<h2 class="mume-header" id="ui">UI</h2>

<p>The system has several basic UI elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the entrypoint to the system. The navigation tab is displayed on every page of the system. It shows the main functional areas of the system:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/navigation.png" alt="Navigation"></p>
<p>Clicking on each of the main elements in the navigation tab shows the elements of that functional area.</p>
<p>General Ledger:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/general-ledger.png" alt="General Ledger"></p>
<p>Inventory:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/inventory.png" alt="Inventory"></p>
<p>Sales:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/sales.png" alt="Sales"></p>
<p>Purchases:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/purchases.png" alt="Purchases"></p>
<p>Admin:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/admin.png" alt="Admin"></p>
<ul>
<li>list</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking on each of the elements in the navigation opens the list of the respective object. Example: Items</p>
<p><img src="./assets/items.png" alt="Items"></p>
<p>Each list has several building blocks:</p>
<p>Header:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/items-header.png" alt="Items-Header"></p>
<p>&quot;New&quot; button - this is available only for objects which can be created manualy by the user</p>
<p><img src="./assets/items-new.png" alt="Items-New"></p>
<p>Table Header - shows the names of the columns (fields) of the object that is listed:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/items-tableheader.png" alt="Items-TableHeader"></p>
<p>Table Lines - shows the actual data, the values of the respective fields of the object being listed:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/items-tablerows.png" alt="Item-TableRows"></p>
<p>Actions - this is usually the last column of the list. It contains buttons to perform various actions over the respective instance of the object being listed:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/items-actions.png" alt="Item-Actions"></p>
<p>Paging - at the bottim of each list there is a section which contains elements to navigate through the pages of the object being listed:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/items-paging.png" alt="Item-Paging"></p>
<ul>
<li>card</li>
</ul>
<p>Card elements are used to create new and/or update existing instances of a particular object. Example: Item</p>
<p><img src="./assets/item-card-new.png" alt="Item-Card-New"></p>
<p>As stated above, card element could be used to create new objects or update existing ones. When used for updating existing ones, it is already populated with the data of the object being edited:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/item-card-existing.png" alt="Item-Card-Existing"></p>
<p>When a card is used for existing object instance, a sublist could also be displayed in the card. This sublist contains information regarding objects related to the main object displayed in the card. Example: in the Item card you see a list of Item Ledger Entries as a sublist:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/item-card-ledger-entries.png" alt="Item-Card-Ledger-Entries"></p>
<ul>
<li>wizard</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some objects which can not be created with a single step. This means that values in some fields are populated automatically based on the values selected in other fields - Sales/Purchase Document Line price is populated from the Item selected in the item field. There are other cases, where values that could be populated in a certain field depend on the value selected in other fields - Source Code field in General Journal Batch Line is populated depending on the value selected in the field Source Type. To cover these cases there is a UI element called Wizard. Wizards are composed of different pages. On each page you select a value and then move on to the next one depending on the values selected on the previous page. Example: Sales Order Wizard:</p>
<p>It is triggered by clicking &quot;New&quot; button on the Sales Order List:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/sales-order-new.png" alt="Sales-Order-New"></p>
<p>Triggering the Sales Order wizard opens its first page. Sales Order customer is selected on the first page of the Sales Order wizard:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/sales-order-wizard-first-page.png" alt="Sales-Order-Wizard-FirstPage"></p>
<p>Once you select the customer for the sales order, clicking &quot;Next&quot; moves to the second page of the Sales Order wizard:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/sales-order-wizard-second-page.png" alt="Sales-Order-Wizard-SecondPage"></p>
<p>You can see on the second page you can select the Payment Method for the Sales Order. The value of the Payment Method is populated from the payment method field of the Customer selected on the previous page. This is an example where values in some fields are populated based on values selected in other fields.</p>
<p>Clicking finish on the last page of the Sales Order Wizard creates a new Sales Order and redirects to the Sales Order Card.</p>
<p>Other objects which are created/updated using wizards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales Order</li>
<li>Sales Order Line</li>
<li>Purchase Order</li>
<li>Purchase Order Line</li>
<li>Sales Credit Memo</li>
<li>Sales Credit Memo Line</li>
<li>Purchase Credit Memo</li>
<li>Purchase Credit Memo Line</li>
<li>General Journal Batch Line</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="processes">Processes</h2>

<p>Besides creating, updating, listing and deleting the domain model objects, there is one main action that could be executed in the system - posting. As it was mentioned in the Domain Model section, Sales/Purchase Orders represent the <strong>intent</strong> of a Customer/Vendor to buy/deliver Items. <strong>Posting</strong> a sales/purchase document (order or credit memo) is confirming this intent and materializes it. This is the simplest way to describe the <strong>Posting</strong> process.</p>
<p>When you post a Sales Order, the following actions are performed by the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posted Sales Order is created using the information from the Sales Order;</li>
<li>for each Sales Order Line a corresponding Posted Sales Order Line is created;</li>
<li>for each Sales Order Line a corresponding Item Ledger Entry is created;</li>
<li>Customer Ledger Entry is created;</li>
<li>depending on the Payment Method, payment/refund Customer Ledger is created;</li>
<li>depending on the Payment Method, Bank Account Ledger entry is created;</li>
<li>Sales Order Lines are deleted;</li>
<li>Sales Order is deleted;</li>
</ul>
<p>All the actions described above are performed in a transaction.</p>
<p>Respective actions are performed when you post Sales Credit Memo, Purchase Order, Purchase Credit Memo and General Journal Batch.</p>
<p>There are some checks which are performed during Posting of documents which could also cause the whole operation (transaction) to fail and be aborted (rollbacked):</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales Order - Item inventory is checked. If there is not enough inventory of a given Item to sell to the Customer, Post operation fails;</li>
<li>Sales Credit Memo - if the Payment Method selected will cause a Customer Refund to be made, Bank Account balance is checked. If there is not enough balance of a given Bank Account to refund the Customer, Post operation fails;</li>
<li>Purchase Order - if the Payment Method selected will cause a Vendor Payment to be made, Bank Account balance is checked. If there is not enough balance of a given Bank Account to pay the Vendor, Post operation fails;</li>
<li>Purchase Credit Memo - Item inventory is checked. If there is not enough inventory of a given Item to return to the Vendor, Post operation fails;</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p><img src="./assets/architecture-v3.png" alt="Architecture-v3"></p>
<p><strong>erp</strong> is two component system - frontend and backend</p>
<p><strong>Frontend</strong> component is responsible for the UI (web application) of the system. It handles all user requests as well as handling all web pages.</p>
<p><strong>Backend</strong> component implements and exposes the application logic via REST API. The responsibilities of the backend component can be divided into two main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>data access - it allows the end user (be it via the UI/front or directly calling the REST APIs) to maintain its data - Items, Customers, Vendors, Documents, etc. The data is stored in external RDBMS. This is one of the external dependencies of the system.</li>
<li>business logic - it allows the end user (be it via the UI/frontend or directly calling the REST APIs) to trigger post operations over different objects - Sales Orders, Purchase Order, General Journals, etc. These operations are executed asynchronously. See [Asynchronous business logic execution](#Asynchronous business logic execution)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="asynchronous-business-logic-execution">Asynchronous business logic execution</h3>

<h2 class="mume-header" id="howtorun">HowToRun</h2>

<p>In order to run the application, you have to build it first. Maven is used as a build tool. You should execute simple maven command in the root of the repo in order to build the application:</p>
<pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info class="language-"><code>$ mvn clean install
</code></pre><p>As described in the Architecture section, the application consists of two components - frontend and backend. Respectively they are modules of the repository. Executing Maven in the root of the repository builds both components.</p>
<p>The minimal maven version required is <strong>3.2.5</strong>.</p>
<p>The result of a successfull maven execution is a jar file located in the <strong>./target</strong> folder of each of the submodules.</p>
<p>First you have to run the backend component. This is done by execution the following command in the root of the repository:</p>
<pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info class="language-"><code>java -jar ./erp.backend/target/backend-*.jar
</code></pre><p>This runs the backend component with embeded H2 in-memory database.</p>
<p>Backend could be run against MySQL database as well. This could be done by providing some input parameters running the component:</p>
<ul>
<li>DB_DRIVER - the MySQL value that should be provided is <strong>com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver</strong>;</li>
<li>DB_URL - the JDBC URL that will be used to connect to the database;</li>
<li>DB_USERNAME - the username to authenticate with;</li>
<li>DB_PASSWORD - the password to authenticate with;</li>
<li>DB_PLATFORM - the MySQL dialect for Hibernate - <strong>org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect</strong></li>
<li>SRV_PORT - the port to run the embedded server on;</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, you have to specify <strong>prod</strong> profile to run Spring with by specifying <strong>spring.profiles.active</strong> environment variable.</p>
<p>Now that you have backend component, next you should run the frontend component. This is done by executing the following command in the root of the repository:</p>
<pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info class="language-"><code>java -jar ./erp.frontend/target/frontend-*.jar
</code></pre><p>This runs the frontend component with default configuration where it tries to communicate with backend component at <strong><a href="http://localhost:8082">http://localhost:8082</a></strong>. You can change this by providing the following input parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li>ERP_BACKENDURL - the endpoint where frontend will use to communicate with backend component;</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, you have to specify <strong>prod</strong> profile to run Spring with by specifying <strong>spring.profiles.active</strong> environment variable.</p>

<p>It was described in the Intro section what the main goals of the project are. In order to focus on the main goals, some other features and functionalities were intentionally left out. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>no sorting/filtering in any of the list UIs;</li>
<li>no data validation when creating any of the objects;</li>
<li>no user context;</li>
<li>no authentication/authorization;</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<p>The application will be developed through the following stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>refactor posting to be asynchronous;</li>
<li>separate backend into domain-based microservices - inventory, sales, purchases, etc.</li>
<li>run locally with docker-compose</li>
<li>run with k8s</li>
</ul>
